McKinney: Yeah this is McKinney.

Allison: It's Allison. We might have something. Hopefully it's nothing but we're making sure. Wanted to give you the heads up.

(*Immediately after call 2*)

### Prompt

Allison: Operator. Line 3, code 1786.

### Call

Allison: Joshua.

Dr. Artes: Ms. Brooks, we're hustling. Most things are coming back nominal, a few things within tolerances. 

Allison: Are you sure?

Dr. Artes: Yes. Instruments don't lie.

Allison: We don't know if those instruments were made to measure things like this.

Dr. Artes: Everything's worked flawlessly so far. I'm confident.

Allison (sarcastic): How comforting. Call me if anything happens.

Dr. Artes: Yes Ms. Brooks.

*CUT OFF BY CALL 4*

Allison: Is that safe? Is it going to break containment?

Dr. Artes: No, I don't think so. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't spooked, but it doesn't appear to be unsafe yet.

Allison: I don't like the word "yet". Hold your ground, keep watching it, I'll deal with it on my end.

Dr. Artes: Don't let them do anything —

(*Allison hangs up*)

(*Dr. Artes sighs*)

Lara: Sir, that goes against protocol —

(*cut off by Call  8*)

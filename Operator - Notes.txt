- Play 4 audio files but only one can be heard at a time ✔
- Spacebar to switch between the active file ✔
- P key to pause or unpause file ✔
- Lights are green when playing, red when paused ✔
- Scriptable Objects to hold event data ✔
- Read that data and load in relevant bits ✔

I need to re-write how I'm handling information, because it currently is messy and it's not going to work for when there are 4 calls happening at any time. I think I need a line manager script that does nothing but handles what line has what information, which needs to include data like the code request text and stuff, which is currently in the flipping game manager, which is not great.

I also need to re-design the Scrambler so that you can engage it on multiple lines. That's a thing.

So, let's imagine a Story Event is triggered:
1) the prompt audio plays and the basic stuff is read in so that the player can activate the call
Basic stuff = line request, code request, needs to be scrambled, what kind of scramble
2) When they have successfully done that, the other information is sent to the Line Manager, which in turns forces the audio file to play
Other stuff = audio file, Text for line monitor (which needs to change), event information (for later)

The Line Manager needs to know:

1) If a line is being used
2) If a button is clicked it passes a parameter of what number it is, 
If that line is being used do nothing
If that line is not being used, AND this is the desired line, say it is in use and run the story event

Okay, so I think I've got the basic loop working without scrambling, next up is adding Scrambling. This begs the question of how I want the scrambler to work - do I want it to be another row of buttons where you select each line? I **could** do that, but that feels very blase. Do I instead keep it as it is? No, because that design creates a situation where it can only be scrambling one line at a time... do I create a second scrambler? How the heck am I going to lock these in place? I like the idea of a second scrambler, but then I have to keep track of two scramblers? I haven't even figured out the first one works yet!

I did it! The Scrambler is done! So that's the major mechanics, next up is the **Codebook** UI, then fix the Request Monitor
